## Case Study: Streamlining COVID-19 Vaccination with ASP.NET MVC

### Overview
- The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the necessity for efficient and accessible vaccination systems. In response, we developed a web-based application using the ASP.NET MVC framework to streamline the vaccination process. This application serves as a user-friendly portal for both general users and administrators, aiming to simplify the booking and management of COVID-19 vaccination slots.

### Objectives
- Simplify Registration and Booking: Provide an intuitive interface for users to register and book vaccination slots easily.
- Efficient Slot Management: Equip administrators with tools to manage vaccination slots and user approvals effectively.
- Secure Tracking: Ensure secure and accurate tracking of vaccination statuses.

### Implementation
- User Registration and Booking

Users can create accounts and log in to the portal.
The system allows users to search for available vaccination slots based on location and date.
Users can book slots and receive confirmation notifications via email or SMS.

### Administrator Tools

- Administrators have access to a dashboard to view and manage all booked slots.
- Tools are provided for approving or rejecting user registrations and slot bookings.
- The system includes features for adding new vaccination centers and updating slot availability.

### Security and Tracking

- The application uses secure authentication methods to protect user data.
- Vaccination statuses are updated in real-time and can be tracked by both users and administrators.
- Detailed logs are maintained for all activities to ensure transparency and accountability.

### Results
- Increased Efficiency: The portal significantly reduced the time required for users to book vaccination slots.
- Improved Management: Administrators reported a more streamlined process for managing slots and user approvals.
- Enhanced Security: The secure tracking system ensured accurate and up-to-date vaccination records.


## Application Overview

- The vaccination portal is designed to cater to two types of users: normal users and administrators. Normal users can register, log in, and book vaccination slots, while administrators have additional functionalities to manage the overall vaccination process. The application ensures a seamless experience.
- Key Features and Functionalities
    - User Registration and Login: New users can register and log in to the portal. Successful registration leads to auto-login and redirection to the user profile page.
    - User Profile Management: Users can view and update their profile information and check their vaccination status.
    - Slot Booking: Users can book available vaccination slots. The status changes from ‘not vaccinated’ to ‘vaccinated’ once approved by the admin.
    - Admin Dashboard: Administrators have access to a dashboard displaying total users, users yet to book slots, users with pending approvals, and available slots in hospitals.
    - Approval and Slot Management: Admins can approve vaccination statuses and update the number of available slots in hospitals.
